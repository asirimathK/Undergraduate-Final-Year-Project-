# Final Year Research: Hate Speech Detection on Facebook in Singlish
This project explores automated hate speech detection on Facebook, focusing on bilingual content in English and Sinhala (Singlish). The research leverages machine learning models—such as BERT, deep learning, decision tree, SVM, logistic regression, random forest, and Naive Bayes—to identify hate speech patterns in user-generated comments.

By preprocessing Singlish data and training various classifiers, the project aims to achieve robust detection in a linguistically complex environment. The outcomes support efforts to moderate harmful content, providing insights for improved social media safety and automated content moderation in Sri Lanka's digital space.
